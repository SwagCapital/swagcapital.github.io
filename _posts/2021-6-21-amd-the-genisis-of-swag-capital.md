## Intro

Throughout most people's investing careers, their first security has always been the toughest one to purchase. 
Maybe you are 60 years old and bought a Treasury bond that returns 50 cents every ten years. 
Or maybe your a **R/WallStreetBets** user who donates your college textbook money to an overworked Goldman quant, who is pricing in how a 5% increase in temperature  in southern Nebraska will cause 30% of the crop to fail increasing corn futures prices.

But despite the wide variance in choice of security, you still bought one. Congratulations, you took the time and the risk, and now you *could* be making money. 
But we aren't here to discuss how you could have made 20% in a year buying ***$SPY*** and dollar-cost averaging, we are here to talk about what I saw in $AMD to get a **300%** return during covid. 

## Monkey See, Monkey Invest

So what leads a person to invest in a company like AMD. 
I mean historically, AMD has always played second fiddle to a company like Intel. 
Even though AMD has both a GPU and CPU division, their Market cap is still only half of Intel's, let alone their market cap when their share price was 20 bucks a share. 

This question of choosing to invest in the smaller of the two companies drives us to the first point in my investment algorithm, the one this article covers, **Finding the Innovations Old Men Ignore**. 
This way of investing will shift the way you think when you purchase securities. 
Avid market enthusiasts might notice this statement is similar to that of famous fund manager Peter Lynch's
> "The worst thing you can do is invest in companies you know nothing about. Unfortunately, buying stocks on ignorance is still a popular American pastime."

On a table reading of this quote, some might assume that to invest in a company like Intel, you need to be a seasoned electrical engineer, who can tell if a CPU is going to be a flop or not. 
Or to invest in a company like Facebook, you need to be a seasoned software developer who is well versed in PHP.
Quite the contrary, I pull a different perspective from that quote, which leads into my philosophy, you don't have to know all about a company or field to invest in it, you just have to know more than the old men on Wallstreet.

So what angle did I find that beat out the quants and funds looking into AMD?
Simple, I play a lot of Counter-Strike (CS), and I mean a lot. 
And for the longest time, I played CS on a small crappy gaming laptop, getting maybe at most, 90 frames a second.
So when I was looking to build my PC, I was faced with a conundrum the consumer electronics space hasn't seen since 2006, AMD or Intel.
See for the longest time in the gaming space, to get the most framerate, you not only needed a good GPU, but a good CPU as well, and the company that produced the best CPUs were Intel.
But with the release of AMD's new chip line, Ryzen, they suddenly became the cool kids on the block.

The new AMD  CPUs were not just competing with Intel, but for the first time in a while, they had beaten their performance. 
But it wasn't just their performance that was better, it was their power efficiency. 
This increased efficiency allows for not only better desktop use, but better laptop usage as well.

## Lesson Learned?

So what did I take away from my first stock? 
I didn't set out to find a growth stock, or a value stock.
To me at the time, a P/E ratio was as valuable as a textbook in Quantum Physics. 

To me, this stock choice was that made on information that I had which is normally painful to research.
I was lucky enough to be a computer nerd who knew about the history between AMD and Intel.
But why did this type of stock play succeed, what was the secret, what was the lesson?
This is what I took away, first, you have to look past the current earnings of a company. 
Yes, earnings are important, but they are past results, not predictors of the future.
I found the money not in creating Discounter Cash Flows, or EBITDA, but by finding public information that earnings had not displayed yet.

While some might fight this advice to be too painfully simple for their investment advice, I prefer to 
> "Keep it simple, stupid." -US Navy

And if you still think that you need to code 30 different spreadsheets that take into account wind patterns, let me end this post with this.
I bought AMD for about 19 dollars at the beginning of 2019 in January.
When I closed the position, the price ballooned to 80 bucks, creating a nifty profit of **%300** or **244** dollars, allowing me to expand my portfolio, and pick stocks that returned similar or greater amounts.

Those next picks we will be discussing in future posts, in the meantime make sure to subscribe to the newsletter, so you can get notified of future posts.
